# ICO PRJECT FOR BUY AND SELL MY TOKEN

- In this project, I aimed to develop a full-stack ICO to facilitate the purchase of my custom ERC20 TOKEN. The design aspect incorporates pure CSS, ReactJS, and React Icons, while the backend is implemented using Solidity.
- I've written smart contractsâ€”one for the ERC20 token and another for the token purchase.
- To enable communication between the frontend and backend, I've employed ethers.js.

- Currently, all functions required for integrating the smart contracts with the frontend have been implemented.
- The next step involves calling these functions in the frontend.
- Additionally, a form with a single input field and a button for token purchase needs to be incorporated.

-I am nearing completion of this project and will work on addressing the remaining tasks to ensure its successful implementation.
